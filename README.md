This is an app that suggests selling a car. In this application, I used objects to pass data from the inputs to the vehicle information frame. I also added a calculation of the age of the car. The current year will be updated thanks to JavaScript. The parameters of the car for sale are just suggestions. For example: age more than 10 years, mileage more than 150000 km, 4 or more visits to the garage over the last 2 years.
